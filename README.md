![Mockup image](docs/headerreadme.png)


# Introduction

- As my first ever game to create, i created Tic-Tac-Toe, it is a simple game and was a great start for me.

- A feedback page, where you can fill out your name, email and message that you want to send me, a pop up will show when you send me an message and a popup will show if you dont filled it out correctly.

- I also created a Quiz, that was interesting and fun, i got to play around with different kinds of code, i got to add some effects and estetics that were really cool to create.
